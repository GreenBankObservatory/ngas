    Test Suite for the  Idle Suspension Feature.

    Description:
    The purpose of the Test Suite is to test the Idle Suspension/Wake-Up
    Feature. As it is not possible to suspend the test node, a special
    Suspension and Wake-Up Plug-in have been provided which simulate that
    the server is suspended without actually suspending it.

    Missing Test Cases:
    - CLONE (from suspended sub-node).
    - Check that node is not suspending itself when:
        - DCC is on-going.
        - Request is being handled.
        - Subscription data being delivered
    - Check that a node suspends itself if configured so, within
      the specified period of time.
    - Check that sub-nodes are woken up at:
        - CONFIG?<Different Combinations>&host_id
        - STATUS: Check if more relevant cases.
    (All tests with HTTP Authentication).

    - RETRIEVE?disk_id&file_id&file_version.
    - CHECKDISK (file on suspended sub-node).
    - Check that node is not suspending itself when subscription data
      being delivered

        Expected Result:
        After starting the server, it should suspend itself after the given
        period of time.

        Test Steps:
        - Start server with a configuration file specifying idle suspension
          after 10s.
        - Wait till the server indicates in the DB that it is suspended
          with a time-out of 20s.

          shut down cleanly.

        Synopsis:
        Check that CHECKFILE?file_id&file_version correctly handled
        when the referenced file is stored on a suspended node.

        Description:
        The purpose of the test is to verify that a CHECKFILE Command is
        properly handled by a Master node acting as a proxy and interacting
        with a suspended sub-node.

        Expected Result:
        The contacted Master Node should identify that the sub-node hosting
        the specified file is suspended, and should wake it up before
        forwarding the request. Subsequently it should forward the request to
        the sub-node and send back the result to the client.

        Test Steps:
        - Start simulated cluster with a sub-node suspending itself after a
          short while.
        - Archive 2 FITS file 2 times each.
        - Wait till the sub-node suspends itself.
        - Send a CHECKFILE Command to the Master node specifying to check
          one of the previously archived files.
        - Check response from the sub-node.
        - Check from the log entries in the Master Node that the CHECKFILE
          Command has been successfully executed.
        - Check from the log entries on the sub-node that  the CHECKFILE
          Command has been successfully executed.

        Synopsis:
        Check that a suspended sub-node is woken up when DCC is due and that
        the DCC is executed as expected after the node has been woken up.

        Description:
        Before suspending itself, a sub-node should request to be woken up
        when the time for executing the next DCC is due.

        The purpose of the test is to verify that a sub-node suspending itself
        requests to be woken up at the specified point in time, and that the
        contacted Master Node wakes up a suspended sub-node as expected.

        Expected Result:
        The contacted Master Node should identify that the sub-node is
        suspended and that it has requested to be woken up by the Master Node
        at a given point in time. The Master Node should wake up the node at
        the requested point in time and the sub-node should carry out the DCC.

        Test Steps:
        - Prepare simulated cluster with a sub-node suspending itself after a
          short while and having DCC enabled with a high frequency.
        - Archive two files onto the sub-node.
        - Wait till the sub-node has suspended itself.
        - Wait till the sub-node has been woken up.
        - Check that entries in the log file on the Master Node indicate
          that it has woken up the suspended sub-node.
        - Check that entries in the log file on the sub-node indicate that it
          has been woken up.
        - Wait until the DCC has been executed and check that the result is
          as expected (the DCC summary log appears in the log file on the
          sub-node).
