    Synopsis:
    Test Suite testing the CONFIG Command.

    Description:
    The purpose of this Test Suite is to test the handling of the CONFIG
    Command in the NG/AMS Server.

    Missing Test Cases:
    - Test proxy mode for CONFIG Command.
    - Many Test Cases are missing. A review of the Test Suite and of the
      CONFIG Command should be carried out and the necessary Test Cases added.

        Synopsis:
        Change the Local (Log File) Log Level Online.

        Description:
        The purpose of this Test Case is to test that the Local Log Level
        can be changed while the NG/AMS Server is Online.

        Expected Result:
        The Log Level should be increased and more logs produced in the Local
        Log File.

        Test Steps:
        - Start normal NG/AMS Server (Log Level=3).
        - Send a CONFIG Command to the server changing the Log Level to 4.
        - Check the response to the CONFIG Command is correct.

        Remarks:
        TODO: Check in Log File that low level logs are produced.
