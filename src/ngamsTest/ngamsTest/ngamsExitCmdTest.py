    Synopsis:
    Test Suite for the  EXIT Command.

    Description:
    The purpose of this Test Suite is to exercise the EXIT Command.
    Both the normal case where exit is granted should be tested, as well
    as when exit is not allowed (if the server is in Online State).

        Synopsis:
        Normal execution EXIT Command/Offline.

        Description:
        Test that the server terminates if the EXIT Command is submitted
        while the server is in Offline State.

        Expected Result:
        The server in Offline State, should accept the EXIT Command and
        perform a clean shut down.

        Test Steps:
        - Start server (Auto Online = 0).
        - Submit EXIT Command.
        - Check that the response is as expected.
        - Check that the server is no longer running.

        Remarks:
        TODO!: Test that the server is no longer running.

        Expected Result:
        The server should generate an Error Response indicating that the
        command cannot be handled when the server is in Online State.

        Test Steps:
        - Start server (Auto Online = 1).
        - Issue EXIT Command.
        - Check that the request is rejected.
        - Check that the server is still running.
