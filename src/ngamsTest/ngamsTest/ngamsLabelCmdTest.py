    Synopsis:
    Test Suite for the LABEL Command.

    Description:
    The purpose of the Test Suite is to exercise the LABEL Command in the
    various ways this is used. This goes for:

      - Printing of labels for a disk referred to by host_id/slot_id.
      - Printing of labels for a disk referred to by its Disk ID.
      - Renaming a disk referring to the disk by its Disk ID.

    Both normal and abnormal conditions are exercised.

    Missing Test Cases:
    - Test LABEL?disk_id.
    - Test re-label feature.
    - Test illegal combinations of parameters.
    - Review Test Suite and add relevant Test Cases.

        Synopsis:
        Test basic handling of the LABEL Command.

        Description:
        The purpose of the Test Case is to verify the normal execution of the
        LABEL Command when specifying to print out a label for a disk referring
        to theof the disk.

        Expected Result:
        The contacted server should find the information for the

        Test Steps:
        - Start server.
        - Submit LABEL Command specifying the host_id/slot_id of the disk.
        - Verify the response from the LABEL Command.
        - Verify the printer file generated by the LABEL Printer Plug-in.
