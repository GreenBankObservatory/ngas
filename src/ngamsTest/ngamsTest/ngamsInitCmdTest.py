        Synopsis:
        Normal execution of INIT Command/cfg. in file.

        Description:
        The purpose of the Test Case is to verify that the server
        re-initializes and reloads the associated cfg. file when the INIT
        Command is received.

        Expected Result:
        When the INIT Command is received by a server in Online State, the
        server should reload the configuration and go into Online State.

        Test Steps:
        - Start server.
        - Issue an INIT Command.
        - Check that response from the server is as expected.

        Remarks:
        TODO: Should change some parameters to verify that the cfg. file is
              actually re-loaded.
