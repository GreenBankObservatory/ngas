    Missing Test Cases:
    - This whole Test Suite should be reviewed and missing Test Cases added.

    - Make dummy Online Plug-In, which returns no physical disks, and check
      the SW behaves as expected (goes online, reports that there are no disks,
      ...).

    - Check that if there are no Disk Sets available and Archiving is disabled,
      no problems are reported.

    - Following Test Cases +/- completed disks:
      - M Slot: M Disk + R Slot: M Disk

        Synopsis:
        Test basic handling of Online Command.

        Description:
        The purpose of the test is to verify that the server goes Online
        initializing with the specified cfg. file when the ONLINE Command is
        issued.

        Expected Result:
        After being started up and in Offline/Idle State and receiving the
        ONLINE Command, the server should re-load the cfg. and should bring
        the system to Online State according to the cfg. file.

        Test Steps:
        - Start server (Auto Online=0).
        - Send ONLINE Command.
        - Check that the response from the server is as expected.

        Remarks:
        TODO: Check that the server is Online (DB + STATUS Command).
